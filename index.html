            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a 2017 Rutgers University Graduate who majored in Information Technology &amp; Informatics and
                minored in Mathematics. While at Rutgers, I came to realize that I'm a creative and enjoyed problem
                solving through my Information Visualization, Web Design, and Math courses. I love the feeling when
                you put so much time and effort into a project and when you're done you say, "All the time and effort
                problem solving and creating the project was worth it"</p>
